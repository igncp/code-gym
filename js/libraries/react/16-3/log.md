# React 16.3 learning log

The logs are in chronological order from the bottom (older) to the top (more recent).

- Started with the new features from v16.3: `getDerivedStateFromProps` first with `DerivedStateComp` and then the context API.

- Added the `CompWithPortal` component to the `App`.

- Added the `CompWithFragments` which uses `React.Fragment`, which was new in v16. Added `ErrorBoundary` component too.

- Created the app with `create-react-app`.
