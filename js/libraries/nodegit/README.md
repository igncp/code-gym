# Nodegit Proof Of Concept

- Most links are in the [main file](src/index.js)
- In the API docs, names starting with `#` are instance methods, without are static methods

## Strategy

### Periodic

- Find resources
- Create flows examples
- Review and modify existing examples
- Note down API docs references in examples

### TODO

- Find how to unit-test the library

## Questions

- How to unstage changes
- How to list files with changes
