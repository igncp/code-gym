# Advent Of Code 19

- https://adventofcode.com/

## List of Completed

- [01](./01)
- [02](./02)

## Objectives

These may change in future, but all examples should comply with them:

- All in TypeScript
- 100% type coverage for `lib.ts`
- 100% line coverage for `lib.ts`
- TDD
- Different approaches:
    - Example: Functional programming, object oriented, data driven
- Minimize dependencies
- All examples should have same:
    - Scripts
    - ESLint, Build, Tests, type-coverage and Prettier config
    - Assertions in `main.ts` with correct values (Obtained after completion)

## TODO:

- Periodic: Refactor interfaces
    - Only expose methods that could be useful, the rest expose only for tests
- Periodic: Add ESLint rules
